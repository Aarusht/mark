# Story Of MARK

Mark was developed when we, Rohan Kumar and Aarush Tayal, Decided we no longer wanna use cortona cuz it sucks
We Decided that as there is no cool assistant, LET'S MAKE OUR OWN

Currently Mark is in beta and u will need to extract the zip file and install all modules

We are planning to make it as an .exe file so be tuned
